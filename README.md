# Welcome to my Examples repository!

This is a basic collection of some school and personal projects I've completed.

## This repository includes:
1. Docker
  - A personal project to build a home server, learn more about how to implement Docker containers, and better understand proxy server implementation.

2. Java
  - Just a few basic examples.

3. Python
  - First folder contains my q-learning ML model for music generation. This was my Capstone Project for my Undergraduate degree.
  - The other files are further examples for you to look at.
    - HammingCode.py was a way for me to better understand the Hamming Algorithm for error checking.  What better way than to write a program!
    - WebsiteParsing.py was mostly practice with Selenium and multi-processing, but I was also very interested in the new graphics cards, so it was a Win-Win for me :).

I realize that a lot of my uploads are pretty old, and it doesn't seem like much is happening.  However, I have another private repository I use for my current projects which include:
  - building up my Full-Stack development skills with a personal website using django and React frameworks.
  - further advancements on my home server, which will also be hosting the above website when completed.
  - continued development on ML techniques.

I plan on uploading these projects upon completion.


# Thank you very much for taking a look at my work!
